# Code of Conduct

Hi! We're so glad you're considering contributing to our project. We  care deeply about biodiversity and helping nature, and we're thrilled to have you on board.

By contributing to our project, you agree to abide by this code of conduct.

## In a Nutshell

Be kind. No harassment, trolling, or spamming.

- **Harassment** includes any kind of behavior that might make someone feel unwelcome, uncomfortable, or unsafe. This includes but is not limited to: sexual language and imagery, deliberate intimidation, stalking, name-calling, unwelcome attention, and any malicious hacking or social engineering. We want our project to be a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, national origin, or religion (or lack thereof).

- **Trolling** includes posting inflammatory comments to provoke an emotional response or disrupt discussions.

- **Spamming** includes posting off-topic messages to disrupt discussions, promote a product, solicit donations, advertise a job/internship/gig, or flooding discussions with files or text.

## Reporting

If you see someone harass, troll, or spam anywhere in our community (forum, chat, GitHub, etc.), please let us know â€“ preferably with a screenshot and URL of the offense. You can reach out to our lead developer h.manders.jones@nbn.org.uk. We will take any action we deem appropriate, up to and including banning the offender from our project.

## Be Kind to Each Other

We're all in this together, and we are all contributing to this project because we care about nature and want to make a positive impact on the world. Let's be kind to each other, assume good intentions, and do our best to create a welcoming and supportive community.

Thank you for contributing!
